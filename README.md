Hello and welcome!

This is a demo for a text based adventure game, created by myself. In this demo you will find your character, who is assigned a name at the beginning of the game (you may use your own, or you may choose to create a new character altogether!), exploring a new place that they can't recall how they got there. You will encounter battle sequences in which you will have a variety of options to choose from, NPC encounters in which you may gather story information from, and your own apartment in which you may save your player stats to!

To operate this game demo, you need to acquire the game code from GitHub (what you are on currently), and run the code as normal.

You will be prompted with a menu screen, in which you may load player stat files if they exist, or choose to start a new game with the basic player stats every player will be given in the beginning. 

Once you either load or start new, you will be prompted to input the player name. Once the player name is input, you will begin the adventure!

To navigate the story, you may press ENTER to run through dialogue. 

To navigate enemy encounters, you will press the first letter of the attributed action. (A for "ATTACK", D for "DEFEND", F for "FLEE", etc.)

To navigate the town, and your apartment, you will also press the first letter of the attributed action (or place);
-H for "HOME"
-T for "TOWN HALL"
-F for "FOREST"
-E for "EXIT"
-S for "SHOP"

(Please note, this is a demo and not all attributes in the town square have written functionality, currently the shop and home are the only resting places you may go)

You may also choose to exit the game to the main menu from your home, in which you will return to the main menu. From the main menu, you may exit the program entirely. 

Thanks for checking out my small demo, and happy coding!
